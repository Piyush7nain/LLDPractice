üöÄ Thread Synchronization and Communication
Implement a thread-safe counter:
Create a counter class with methods to increment, decrement, and get the count safely in a multithreaded environment.
Use synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and AtomicInteger ‚Äî explore all methods.

Producer-Consumer Problem (Bounded Buffer):
Implement a thread-safe queue where producers add items and consumers remove them.
Use wait(), notify(), and blocking queues.

Thread Join Simulation:
Implement a custom version of Thread.join() using wait() and notify().

Print Numbers Alternately (Even-Odd problem):
Two threads print numbers 1 to N ‚Äî one prints even, the other prints odd numbers, in order.
Use thread synchronization to maintain the correct sequence.

üî• Concurrency Patterns and Locks

Dining Philosophers Problem:
Solve this classic problem using threads and locks.
Explore solutions using both mutexes and semaphores.

Read-Write Lock Implementation:
Design a custom Read-Write lock class.
Ensure multiple readers can access simultaneously, but writers get exclusive access.

Thread Pool Implementation:
Implement a simple thread pool executor.
Support execute(), shutdown(), and task queuing.

ReentrantLock and Condition Variables:
Create a class that uses ReentrantLock and Condition to manage thread communication (like producer-consumer but without synchronized).

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Concepts
Implement Future and Callable:
Create a simple Future interface and thread pool that can execute tasks and return results asynchronously.

Rate Limiter (Token Bucket Algorithm):
Design a thread-safe rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm to control how many tasks can be processed per second.

Custom CyclicBarrier:
Implement a CyclicBarrier that lets N threads wait for each other before proceeding.

Implement a Thread-safe Singleton:
Write a singleton class that is safe for concurrent use ‚Äî explore double-checked locking and volatile.

üåü Real-world Inspired Scenarios
File Reader using Multithreading:
Create a program where multiple threads read a large file in chunks and process them concurrently.

Rate Limiter for API Requests:
Implement a multithreaded rate limiter for handling incoming API requests.

Thread-safe Logger:
Design a thread-safe logger that logs messages from multiple threads without corruption.

Task Scheduling System:
Build a simple task scheduler where tasks run at fixed intervals using ScheduledExecutorService.
