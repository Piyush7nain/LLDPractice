🚗 Ride-Sharing System with Multi-Threading Focus (Second Question)
We'll design a ride-sharing platform where the focus is on:

Ride Search Strategies (Strategy Pattern)
Concurrent Ride Booking & Search (Multi-threading)
Here’s a detailed breakdown.

📋 1. High-Level Overview:
We are building a Ride-Sharing Application that allows users to:

Offer Rides (drivers)
Search for Rides (passengers)
Book Rides Concurrently (multi-threading focus)
🚀 2. Core Functional Requirements:
🧑‍✈️ A. Driver/Ride Offering:
A driver can offer a ride by specifying:
Origin and Destination
Available Seats
Vehicle Type (e.g., Car, Bike, SUV)
Driver Name
A driver can update the ride to change available seats.
👥 B. Ride Searching:
Passengers can search for rides based on:

Most Available Seats: Select the ride with the maximum number of available seats.
Preferred Vehicle Type: Select rides that match the preferred vehicle (e.g., only Cars).
✅ Design Note: Use the Strategy Pattern to support flexible search strategies.

🪑 C. Ride Booking:
Passengers can book seats from available rides.
Concurrent Bookings: Multiple passengers should be able to book rides simultaneously.
Prevent overbooking (race condition handling required).
⚡ 3. Concurrency Requirements (Focus Area):
🧵 A. Thread-Safety:
Ensure that available seats are correctly updated when multiple threads (passengers) book rides simultaneously.
Avoid race conditions using thread-safe constructs.
🔗 B. Synchronization:
Use synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, or other concurrency utilities to ensure atomic operations.
Implement a thread pool to simulate multiple users booking/searching for rides concurrently.
📊 C. Performance:
Optimize for performance:
Reduce lock contention.
Implement read-write locks where necessary (many reads, fewer writes).
🗂️ 4. Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability: Support hundreds of concurrent users.
Maintainability: Easily add new search strategies (e.g., by price, driver rating).
Robustness: Gracefully handle failed bookings or exceptions.
🎯 5. System Entities (Classes):
A. User Class:
Fields: userId, name
Methods: searchRide(), bookRide(), etc.
B. Ride Class:
Fields: rideId, origin, destination, availableSeats, vehicleType, driver
Methods: bookSeat(), updateSeats(), etc. (thread-safe methods)
C. RideService Class:
Manages all rides (add, remove, search, book).
Handles concurrency controls.
D. SearchStrategy Interface (Strategy Pattern):
Method: List<Ride> search(List<Ride> rides, SearchCriteria criteria)
Implementations:
MostAvailableSeatsStrategy
PreferredVehicleStrategy
E. BookingManager Class:
Manages concurrent booking logic.
Uses locks to ensure thread safety.
🧪 6. Sample Scenarios to Test:
✅ Basic Functionality:
Driver offers a ride from City A → City B with 3 seats.
Passenger searches for rides and books 1 seat.
Validate that the available seats decrease to 2.
🔀 Concurrent Booking:
5 passengers attempt to book seats simultaneously from a ride with 3 seats.
System should allow only 3 successful bookings.
Remaining 2 should receive "Ride Full" error.
🔎 Search Strategy Switching:
Passenger searches for rides:
First using Most Available Seats strategy.
Then switches to Preferred Vehicle strategy.
Ensure correct rides are returned in each case.
🚩 Edge Cases:
Booking after ride is full → should throw an error.
Concurrent seat updates and bookings → ensure consistency.
Invalid bookings (e.g., booking 0 seats) → handle gracefully.
🔑 7. Concurrency Mechanisms to Use:
ReentrantLock for fine-grained locking on individual rides.
ExecutorService to simulate multiple concurrent users.
AtomicInteger for thread-safe seat counters (optional).
Read-Write Locks if search frequency is high compared to bookings.
🚦 8. Example Use Case:
Driver John offers a ride from Delhi → Gurgaon with 4 seats (SUV).
5 Passengers try to book the ride concurrently.
At the same time, other users are searching for rides with the Most Available Seats strategy.
System handles all operations smoothly without overbooking or inconsistent search results.
